Dear (Digital) Diary,

I increasingly feel like I am not in control of my life. I thought that the deterministic universe was I ridiculous point of view; after all, I *choose* what I do (don't I?). But, for the past few days, it feels like I am just a character in a storyâ€”following some predefined plot that I am (un?)fortunately not privy to. Oh well, [to English I go.](english.html) 

Signed,

Mark
