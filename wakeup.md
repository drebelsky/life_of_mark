Dear (Digital) Diary,

Good morning! Last night I had a weird dream. I looked at my clock, and it was 3:23 in the morning. There was some weird guy who was trying to contact me, and it didn't matter what I typed into my phone, the characters were entered for me, and they didn't even match the resulting message that was sent! Sorry about the rambly nature, I feel like I woke up in the middle of the night for some reason.

See you soon,

Mark

P.S. Do you think I should go [back to sleep](backtosleep.html) or [just go to school](toschool.html)?
