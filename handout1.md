Storytelling is an ancient practice of humans, and some argue further that it's an essential quality in what makes us human. But, this is all well-known, what I'd like to address here is (some of) the various methods of storytelling. More specifically, I'd like to compare novel- and book-based storytelling to that of video game storytelling. Of course, we also have the middle ground of interactive fiction (which is typically facilitated through the use of technology).

Generally speaking, if we want to make this comparison, we would categorize novel-based storytelling as effectively devoid of choice: you read and experience solely what the author has given you, and you do this in the same manner as everyone else. On the opposite end of the spectrum, we have a story told in an open-world video game where choice is given to the participant to influence how the story develops. In some ways, we could extend this further, the story that one experiences in one's own life is strongly influenced (but not exclusively influenced by that person's choices).

(Brief aside incoming.
Note the use of novel-based instead of book-based storytelling above. Some books very clearly break this over-generalized description [e.g., the [_Choose Your Own Adventure books_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choose_Your_Own_Adventure) or [_MAZE: Solve the World's Most Challenging Puzzle_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAZE:_Solve_the_World%27s_Most_Challenging_Puzzle) (which, I suppose, was described by the author as "not really a book")].)

As a creator, it may feel like we are left with an unfair dichotomy—we either get complete control over the audience's experience (well, really their choices) with minimal audience engagement or complete audience engagement with minimal control over the audience's experience. Of course, this description of the dichotomy is not fully accurate, but it approximates the idea well enough. If we want to make a certain point, (generally written) linear (in the sense that they can only go one way) narratives or other constructions appeal to us as storytellers/information sharers in that we can be (reasonably) sure the audience will get at least the gist of what we want (of course, there may be concerns about comprehensibility or that some people might be illiterate, etc…). But, certain messages feel more impactful if they're acquired experientially; it may be harder to achieve this state, but if achieved, the rewards may be greater. To some extent (at some times), it's more fun to interact with and have control over a story. We have this power in all types of stories (in the way we choose to envision them and in how much we think about the story's underlying themes and in how much we listen to the story), but the easier and more defined this choice feels, the more we tend to enjoy it.

I'd like to think this is the reason for the creation of interactive/digital fiction. It provides a realm of easy middle ground between video games and novels in the sense that the author gets to add audience choice without having to add too much additional time in story creation. Of course, some may find it hard to give up control over how the reader interacts with the work: we want to let the reader engage with the work, but we also want them to read the story we've written. For people like that, I propose a solution: forced-interaction interactive fiction. The user is provided with a minimal amount of choice—while their actions further the story, they can only act in a set number of predefined ways. E.g., they may only be able to choose wrong answers on a digital test. Of course, this isn't really a new idea or necessarily even a concept that deserves to have its own name, it's just a thing that exists on the continuum of storytelling closer to the side of author control than reader (listener/audience member/viewer) control.
