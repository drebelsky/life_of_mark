<center><h3>Musing On Storytelling</h3>
<h4>By Mr. Jackson</h4>
</center>
<p>Storytelling is an ancient practice of humans, and some argue further that it’s an essential quality in what makes us human. But, this is all well-known, what I’d like to address here is (some of) the various methods of storytelling. More specifically, I’d like to compare novel- and book-based storytelling to that of video game storytelling. Of course, we also have the middle ground of interactive fiction (which is typically facilitated through the use of technology).</p>
<p>Generally speaking, if we want to make this comparison, we would categorize novel-based storytelling as effectively devoid of choice: you read and experience solely what the author has given you, and you do this in the same manner as everyone else. On the opposite end of the spectrum, we have a story told in an open-world video game where choice is given to the participant to influence how the story develops. In some ways, we could extend this further, the story that one experiences in one’s own life is strongly influenced (but not exclusively influenced by that person’s choices).</p>
<p>(Brief aside incoming. Note the use of novel-based instead of book-based storytelling above. Some books very clearly break this over-generalized description [e.g., the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choose_Your_Own_Adventure"><em>Choose Your Own Adventure books</em></a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAZE:_Solve_the_World%27s_Most_Challenging_Puzzle"><em>MAZE: Solve the World’s Most Challenging Puzzle</em></a> (which, I suppose, was described by the author as “not really a book”)].)</p>
<p>As a creator, it may feel like we are left with an unfair dichotomy—we either get complete control over the audience’s experience (well, really their choices) with minimal audience engagement or complete audience engagement with minimal control over the audience’s experience. Of course, this description of the dichotomy is not fully accurate, but it approximates the idea well enough. If we want to make a certain point, linear (in the sense that they can only go one way) narratives or other constructions appeal to us as storytellers/information sharers in that we can be (reasonably) sure the audience will get at least the gist of what we want (of course, there may be concerns about comprehensibility or that some people might be illiterate, etc…). But, certain messages feel more impactful if they’re acquired experientially; it may be harder to achieve this state, but if achieved, the rewards may be greater. To some extent (at some times), it’s more fun to interact with and have control over a story. We have this power in all types of stories (in the way we choose to envision them and in how much we think about the story’s underlying themes and in how much we listen to the story), but the easier and more defined this choice feels, the more we tend to enjoy it.</p>
<p>I’d like to think this is the reason for the creation of interactive/digital fiction. It provides a realm of easy middle ground between video games and novels in the sense that the author gets to add audience choice without having to add too much additional time in story creation. Of course, some may find it hard to give up control over how the reader interacts with the work: we want to let the reader engage with the work, but we also want them to read the story we’ve written. For people like that, I propose a solution: forced-interaction interactive fiction. The user is provided with a minimal amount of choice—while their actions further the story, they can only act in a set number of predefined ways. E.g., they may only be able to choose wrong answers on a digital test. Of course, this isn’t really a new idea or necessarily even a concept that deserves to have its own name, it’s just a thing that exists on the continuum of storytelling closer to the side of author control than the side of reader (listener/audience member/viewer) control. For an example of what this may look like, see <a href="start.html">here</a>.</p>

<center><h3>Musing On Choice and Determinism</h3>
<h4>By Mr. Jackson</h4>
<h5 id="alternative-title-the-illusion-of-choice">(Alternative title: The Illusion of Choice)</h5></center>
<p>We all like to think that choice is real; that is to say, we like to think that we choose things and are in (at least partial) control of our world. Determinism offers a counter perspective; if the universe is deterministic (that is to say, if knowing the state of the universe exactly at one moment in time enables one to exactly predict the state of the universe at the next moment and time and so on), then this is just an interesting illusion: we think that we influence the world, but really, all of our choices are “decided” (governed) by physical laws and quantum interactions. Furthermore, if we believe in a 4-dimensional space where past, present, and future exist simultaneously, all of our “choices” have already been made. (Additionally, now—like choice/free-will—is just a convenient illusion in this worldview.) Of course, there’s no way to prove this—just like there’s no way to prove that the world wasn’t invented <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=last+thursdayism">last Thursday</a>, that the past is real, or even that causality is real. To someone of this worldview, whether we choose to subscribe to it or not is irrelevant to its accuracy. However, since if it doesn’t exist, it offers no practical applications (except, perhaps, to alleviate a bit of guilt and stress brought on by decision making), I propose that we choose (that is, of course, presuming we can) to disregard the notion as unimportant.</p>
<p>To some extent, the way we view choice is still an illusion. We like to think we exert a strong control over our lives, but the actions of others (which are mostly uncontrollable by ourselves) can have much more significant impacts. If a stranger chooses to drink and drive a car, that person could hit and kill you victimizing you for what felt like an innocent choice (or at least, a choice that you couldn’t reasonably be expected to have made better, e.g., walking on a sidewalk). Now, barring death, we may still be seriously injured. At this point, one may point out that we control our conscious appraisal of our life, and while I concede this, I do so only in technicality for I suspect that most of us don’t have the mental fortitude to instantly be cheery about a negative (once again, I presume to most people) experience.</p>

<center><h3>Storytelling Musing Two</h3>
<h4>By Mr. Jackson</h4>
</center>
<p>One way to tell a story is from a first-person point of view. We typically do this to make the story more intimate. One way to do this is by writing letters. However, note that regarding our previous discussion of interactivity, a first-person story might not always lend itself toward audience interactivity—in which case, we might choose to tell our story from a second-person point of view. In the case of interactive fiction (or forced interactive fiction), perhaps we blur these lines and make the reader and the protagonist almost the same person, but at times, distinctly different. Anyway, I like the intimacy provided by this approach, but it makes it harder for the author to provide story-context that the character wouldn’t know. For example, if the protagonist gets hits by a car (perhaps driven by a drunk stranger), how do you indicate this? You could, of course, switch who's talking, and for example, put in an obituary or picture of a gravestone, but then as audience members, we lose the voice that we’ve grown accustomed to hearing with the tradeoff that we get to hear a different story.</p>

<center><h3>Storytelling Musing Three</h3>
<h4>By Mr. Jackson</h4>
<h5>On Foreshadowing, Nested-Narratives, Breaking the Fourth Wall, Author Interactions, and Author Intentionality</h5>
</center>
<p>In respect to you the student, I will try to keep this last handout rather brief, and to do so, I’m not going to give super in-depth descriptions of the above terms. I’d like to start by bringing to mind the idea that authors occasionally want to interact with the reader in the text. Sometimes, this may be explicit, and sometimes, it may be more subdued. Sometimes the author chooses to speak in their own voice, and sometimes they use the characters, having them “break the fourth wall,” i.e., acknowledge the audience. Sometimes, the author may choose to have the character read something and may choose to include that same thing verbatim in their work so that the reader also reads it. For example, I could include this paper in a story about a high schooler that I have written for you (my students) so that you too would gain an understanding of these terms with the character. Sometimes, the author may choose to write a comment that calls to mind the idea that the words written down were written down by them; one reason to do this would be for humor. For example, I could write a story where one of the characters at one point says something to the effect of “It feels like I am just a character in a story—following some predefined plot that I am (un?)fortunately not privy to.” with the intended effect of you (the audience) going “ha, get it, it’s funny because they <em>are</em> a character, following a plot!” And, obviously, foreshadowing is when the author alludes to a plot point that will happen later in the story; for example, as above, if a character is going to get hit by a car driven by a drunk stranger, the story may start with the character saying they’re afraid of drunk drivers. Of course, these tools can be combined together. For example, this musing could be included in a story about a high schooler who would die because of a drunk-driver with you (my students) as the audience.</p>
<p>P.S. Regarding author intentionality, I think it’s important to acknowledge that not every potential choice that could be interpreted as having meaning has an important meaning.</p>
<p>P.P.S I just realized I forgot to mention anything about nested-narratives, but they can also be used along the same lines. The character may read (or write) a story that demonstrates a simpler version of the same story that they are to follow.</p>
