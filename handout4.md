In respect to you the student, I will try to keep this last handout rather brief, and to do so, I'm not going to give super in-depth descriptions of the above terms. I'd like to start by bringing to mind the idea that authors occasionally want to interact with the reader in the text. Sometimes, this may be explicit, and sometimes, it may be more subdued. Sometimes the author chooses to speak in their own voice, and sometimes they use the characters, having them "break the fourth wall," i.e., acknowledge the audience. Sometimes, the author may choose to have the character read something and may choose to include that same thing verbatim in their work so that the reader also reads it. For example, I could include this paper in a story about a high schooler that I have written for you (my students) so that you too would gain an understanding of these terms with the character. Sometimes, the author may choose to write a comment that calls to mind the idea that the words written down were written down by them; one reason to do this would be for humor. For example, I could write a story where one of the characters at one point says something to the effect of "It feels like I am just a character in a storyâ€”following some predefined plot that I am (un?)fortunately not privy to." with the intended effect of you (the audience) going "ha, get it, it's funny because they are a character, following a plot!" And, obviously, foreshadowing is when the author alludes to a plot point that will happen later in the story; for example, as above, if a character is going to get hit by a car driven by a drunk stranger, the story may start with the character saying they're afraid of drunk drivers. Of course, these tools can be combined together. For example, this musing could be included in a story.


P.S. Regarding author intentionality, I think it's important to acknowledge that not every potential choice that could be interpreted as having meaning has an important meaning.
