Dear (Digital) Diary,

It's nice to talk to you again after trodding my way through more of Mr. Johnson's questionable prose. I guess the biggest thing on my mind is that if I were to read these musings as part of a story, I would assume that one of the characters (or I suppose, *the* character) was going to get hit by a drunk driver in a car. Like, it felt like it was some really blunt foreshadowing, but I suppose it could've just been a red herring, oh well, [who's to say](choice.html)?

Signed,

Mark
