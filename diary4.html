<p>Dear (Digital) Diary,</p>
<p>It’s nice to talk to you again after trodding my way through more of Mr. Johnson’s questionable prose. I guess the biggest thing on my mind is that if I were to read these musings as part of a story, I would assume that one of the characters (or I suppose, <em>the</em> character) was going to get hit by a drunk driver in a car. Like, it felt like it was some really blunt foreshadowing, but I suppose it could’ve just been a red herring, oh well, <a href="choice.html">who’s to say</a>?</p>
<p>Signed,</p>
<p>Mark</p>
