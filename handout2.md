##### (Alternative title: The Illusion of Choice)

We all like to think that choice is real; that is to say, we like to think that we choose things and are in (at least partial) control of our world. Determinism offers a counter perspective; if the universe is deterministic (that is to say, if knowing the state of the universe exactly at one moment in time enables one to exactly predict the state of the universe at the next moment and time and so on), then this is just an interesting illusion: we think that we influence the world, but really, all of our choices are "decided" (governed) by physical laws and quantum interactions. Furthermore, if we believe in a 4-dimensional space where past, present, and future exist simultaneously, all of our "choices" have already been made. (Additionally, now—like choice/free-will—is just a convenient illusion in this worldview.) Of course, there's no way to prove this—just like there's no way to prove that the world wasn't invented [last Thursday](https://www.google.com/search?q=last+thursdayism), that the past is real, or even that causality is real. To someone of this worldview, whether we choose to subscribe to it or not is irrelevant to its accuracy. However, since if it doesn't exist, it offers no practical applications (except, perhaps, to alleviate a bit of guilt and stress brought on by decision making), I propose that we choose (that is, of course, presuming we can) to disregard the notion as unimportant.

To some extent, the way we view choice is still an illusion. We like to think we exert a strong control over our lives, but the actions of others (which are mostly uncontrollable by ourselves) can have much more significant impacts. If a stranger chooses to drink and drive a car, that person could hit and kill you victimizing you for what felt like an innocent choice (or at least, a choice that you couldn't reasonably be expected to have made better, e.g., walking on a sidewalk). Now, barring death, we may still be seriously injured. At this point, one may point out that we control our conscious appraisal of our life, and while I concede this, I do so only in technicality for I suspect that most of us don't have the mental fortitude to instantly be cheery about a negative (once again, I presume to most people) experience.
