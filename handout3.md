One way to tell a story is from a first-person point of view. We typically do this to make the story more intimate. One way to do this is by writing letters. However, note that regarding our previous discussion of interactivity, a first-person story might not always lend itself toward audience interactivityâ€”in which case, we might choose to tell our story from a second-person point of view. In the case of interactive fiction (or forced interactive fiction), perhaps we blur these lines and make the reader and the protagonist almost the same person, but at times, distinctly different. Anyway, I like the intimacy provided by this approach, but it makes it harder for the author to provide story-context that the character wouldn't know. For example, if the protagonist gets hits by a car (perhaps driven by a drunk stranger), how do you indicate this? You could, of course, switch whose talking, and for example, put in an obituary or picture of a gravestone, but then as audience members, we lose the voice that we've grown accustomed to hearing with the tradeoff that we get to hear a different story.
