Dear Mark,

I know you won't get to read this, but I wanted to thank you for involving me in your life. I really didn't think that foreshadowing was an element of real life, and I am saddened by your passing. I know I'm not as good of a writer as you were, I'm sorry that I'm not as good at expressing my emotions, and I'm sorry that we won't be able to converse anymore.

I'll miss you,

Your Digital Diary
