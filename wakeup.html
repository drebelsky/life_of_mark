<p>Dear (Digital) Diary,</p>
<p>Good morning! Last night I had a weird dream. I looked at my clock, and it was 3:23 in the morning. There was some weird guy who was trying to contact me, and it didn’t matter what I typed into my phone, the characters were entered for me, and they didn’t even match the resulting message that was sent! Sorry about the rambly nature, I feel like I woke up in the middle of the night for some reason.</p>
<p>See you soon,</p>
<p>Mark</p>
<p>P.S. Do you think I should go <a href="backtosleep.html">back to sleep</a> or <a href="toschool.html">just go to school</a>?</p>
